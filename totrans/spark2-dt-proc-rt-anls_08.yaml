    nodes (drivers or executors). In this section, we will discuss in brief how to
    monitor Spark jobs using Spark web UI with appropriate examples. We will see how
    to monitor the progress of jobs (including submitted, queued, and running jobs).
    All the tabs in the Spark web UI will be discussed briefly. Finally, we will discuss
    the logging procedure in Spark for better tuning.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a high level, when any action is called on the RDD, Spark creates the DAG
    and submits it to the DAG scheduler. The DAG scheduler divides operators into
    stages of tasks. A stage comprises tasks based on partitions of the input data.
    The DAG scheduler pipelines operators together. For example, many map operators
    can be scheduled in a single stage. The final result of a DAG scheduler is a set
    of stages. The stages are passed on to the task scheduler. The task scheduler
    launches tasks through the cluster manager (Spark Standalone/YARN/Mesos). The
    task scheduler doesn't know about the dependencies of the stages. The worker executes
    the tasks on the stage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DAG scheduler then keeps track of which RDDs the stage outputs materialized
    from. It then finds a minimal schedule to run jobs and divides the related operators
    into stages of tasks. Based on the partitions of the input data, a stage comprises
    multiple tasks. Then, operators are pipelined together with the DAG scheduler.
    Practically, more than one map or reduce operator (for example) can be scheduled
    in a single stage.

    to track them through internal registries and counters. Technically speaking,
    DAG scheduler is a part of SparkContext's initialization that works exclusively
    on the driver (immediately after the task scheduler and scheduler backend are
    ready). DAG scheduler is responsible for three major tasks in Spark execution.
    It computes an execution DAG, that is, DAG of stages, for a job. It determines
    the preferred node to run each task on and handles failures due to shuffle output
    files being lost.

    Java GC is somewhat busy with, or cannot do, the GC fast. For example, the following
    figure shows that for task 0, it took 10 hours to finish the GC! I experienced
    this issue in 2014, when I was new to Spark. Control of these types of issues,

    to the lack of data serialization. This will be discussed in the next section.
    The fifth factor could be the memory leak in the code that will tend to make your
    application consume more memory, leaving the files or logical devices open. Therefore,
    make sure that there is no option that tends to be a memory leak. For example,
    it is a good practice to finish your Spark application by calling `sc.stop()`
    or `spark.stop()`. This will make sure that one SparkContext is still open and
    active. Otherwise, you might get unwanted exceptions or issues. The sixth issue
    is that we often keep too many open files, and this sometimes creates `FileNotFoundException`
    in the shuffle or merge stage.

    categorized as execution and storage. Execution memory is used during the computation
    in merge, shuffles, joins, sorts, and aggregations. On the other hand, storage
    memory is used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster. In
    short, this is due to the large amount of I/O across the network.

    or interactively, caching or persistence are optimization techniques in Spark.
    This two help in saving interim partial results so that they can be reused in
    subsequent stages. Then these interim results (as RDDs) can be kept in memory
    (default) or more solid storage, such as a disk, and/or replicated. Furthermore,
    RDDs can be cached using cache operations too. They can also be persisted using
    a persist operation. The difference between cache and persist operations is purely
    syntactic. The cache is a synonym of persisting or persists (`MEMORY_ONLY`), that
    is, the cache is merely persisted with the default storage level `MEMORY_ONLY`.

    This is the most memory-efficient option, allowing operations on the RDDs to run
    as fast as possible. You should let it go with this because this is the most memory-efficient
    option. This also allows numerous operations on the RDDs to be done as fast as
