- en: Apache Spark is an in-memory, cluster-based data processing system that provides
    a wide range of functionalities such as big data processing, analytics, machine
    learning, and more. With this Learning Path, you can take your knowledge of Apache
    Spark to the next level by learning how to expand Spark's functionality and building
    your own data flow and machine learning programs on this platform. You will work
    with the different modules in Apache Spark, such as interactive querying with
    Spark SQL, using DataFrames and datasets, implementing streaming analytics with
    Spark Streaming, and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques on
    Spark using MLlib and various external tools. By the end of this elaborately designed
    Learning ...

- en: If you are an intermediate-level Spark developer looking to master the advanced
    capabilities and use-cases of Apache Spark 2.x, this Learning Path is ideal for
    you. Big data professionals who want to learn how to integrate and use the features
    of Apache Spark and build a strong big data pipeline will also find this Learning
    Path useful. To grasp the concepts explained in this Learning Path, you must know
    the fundamentals of Apache Spark and Scala.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *A First Taste and What''s New in Apache Spark V2*, provides an
    overview of Apache Spark, the functionality that is available within its modules,
    and how it can be extended. It covers the tools available in the Apache Spark
    ecosystem outside the standard Apache Spark modules for processing and storage.
    It also provides tips on performance tuning.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Operating system:** Linux distributions are preferable (including Debian,
    Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS) and to be more specific, for Ubuntu it is recommended
    to have a complete 14.04 (LTS) 64-bit (or later) installation, VMWare player 12,
    or Virtual box. You can run Spark jobs on Windows (XP/7/8/10) or Mac OS X (10.4.7+).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hardware configuration:** Processor Core i3, Core i5 (recommended), or Core
    i7 (to get the best results). However, multicore processing will provide faster
    data processing and scalability. You will need least 8-16 GB RAM (recommended)
    for a standalone mode and at least 32 GB RAM for a single VM--and higher for a
    cluster. You will also need enough storage for running heavy jobs (depending on
    the dataset size you will be handling), and preferably at least 50 GB of free
    disk storage (for a standalone word missing and for an SQL warehouse).'
